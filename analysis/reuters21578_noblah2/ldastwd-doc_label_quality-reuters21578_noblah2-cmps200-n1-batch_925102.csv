By January, its estimate of 1986<br/>planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.<br/>    Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in<br/>1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year&apos;s good<br/>demand and firm prices will be repeated next year.

But under the 1987 plan, the government<br/>will not pick up the tab for storage.<br/>    Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from<br/>participating in the program, which could result in more<br/>cotton. &quot;The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of<br/>25 pct of a farmer&apos;s base acreage,&quot; noted Judy Weissman of<br/>Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to<br/>participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage <br/>they have.<br/>    Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding<br/>Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the<br/>program. &quot;Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,&quot; said<br/>one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part<br/>on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its<br/>annual meeting in late January.<br/>    But others disagreed. &quot;I think some Western growers have<br/>decided they should be in the program for security reasons.<br/>There&apos;s a lot of comfort in knowing you&apos;ll be guaranteed the<br/>government&apos;s loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the<br/>program is subject to the wiles of the market,&quot; said Walter<br/>Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.<br/>    Some cotton specialists said their expectations for<br/>increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday&apos;s planting<br/>intentions report. &quot;Anything the USDA is announcing now is<br/>based on information they gathered before their cotton program<br/>was announced (on March 20),&quot; one analyst cautioned. She said<br/>traders will get a better idea of next year&apos;s cotton output<br/>when the USDA&apos;s planted acreage report is released on July 9.<br/>    Brown took that opinion a step further. &quot;I don&apos;t think<br/>planted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment<br/>rate,&quot; the difference between acreage planted and acreage<br/>harvested.<br/>    Brown said the abandonment rate this year was &quot;pretty high&quot;<br/>at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing<br/>states. &quot;More normal would be about six pct,&quot; he said.<br/> Reuter<br/>","2003 in Afghanistan","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_in_Afghanistan","Soybean","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean","","2"

Cool and rainy<br/>weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are<br/>rated as slightly below normal.<br/>    In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with<br/>heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.<br/>    In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it<br/>was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which<br/>continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work<br/>impossible.<br/>    In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was<br/>favourable for beet growth, Licht said.<br/>    In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring<br/>beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.<br/>    In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,<br/>it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was<br/>generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.<br/>    In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall<br/>boosted beet development.<br/>    Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes<br/>between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to<br/>delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where<br/>beets are maturing very early this year.<br/> Reuter<br/>","Showbread Bootlegs","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showbread_Bootlegs","Climate of the United Kingdom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_the_United_Kingdom","","2"

King Fahd<br/>said Saudi Arabia, the world&apos;s largest oil exporter, was<br/>adhering to decisions made at OPEC&apos;s December conference which<br/>set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987.<br/>    A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the<br/>group&apos;s pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.<br/>    The King also urged the world community to help the<br/>Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful<br/>end to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not be<br/>resolved on the battlefield, he said.<br/> REUTER<br/>","OPEC","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC","Clifton Hampden","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton_Hampden","","1"

Wednesday borrowings were<br/>1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.<br/>    &quot;One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it<br/>probably isn&apos;t,&quot; said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.<br/>    Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy<br/>modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the<br/>two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging<br/>around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.<br/>    However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest<br/>two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand<br/>often pushes up borrrowings.<br/>    &quot;Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it<br/>looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions<br/>late in the statement period and didn&apos;t quite make it,&quot; said<br/>Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.<br/>    A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that<br/>the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or<br/>more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.<br/>    Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in<br/>its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer<br/>reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.<br/>    The Fed took no market reserve management action last<br/>Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added<br/>temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of<br/>customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves<br/>directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.<br/>    Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the<br/>two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on<br/>Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday&apos;s<br/>overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.<br/>    &quot;It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at<br/>this time,&quot; said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.<br/>    Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi<br/>said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest<br/>rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak<br/>economies in the United States and abroad and add to the<br/>financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.<br/>    &quot;Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest<br/>statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar<br/>tumbled,&quot; said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.<br/>    He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new<br/>statement period began today on disappointment yesterday&apos;s<br/>Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed<br/>to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.<br/>    In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in<br/>Wednesday&apos;s G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that<br/>the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade<br/>imbalance between the United States and Japan.<br/>    The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for<br/>steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average<br/>Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct.

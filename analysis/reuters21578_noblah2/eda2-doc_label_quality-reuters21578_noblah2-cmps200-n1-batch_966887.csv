Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB&gt; and J.P.<br/>Morgan Co&apos;s &lt;JPM&gt; Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits<br/>to cover transactions, it said.<br/>    The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose<br/>from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme<br/>Court in Texaco&apos;s ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL&gt; over<br/>the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.<br/>    The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco&apos;s<br/>plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.<br/>    &quot;Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they<br/>could,&quot; Elton said. But following Monday&apos;s Supreme Court<br/>ruling, Texaco&apos;s suppliers began demanding cash and halting<br/>supplies.<br/>    &quot;It wasn&apos;t until last Wednesday that it turned into an<br/>avalanche,&quot; he said. &quot;Supplies were cut to the point where we<br/>could not run the system at anywhere near capacity.&quot;<br/>    He said less than half of Texaco&apos;s oil supplies had been in<br/>jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages<br/>by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton<br/>said.<br/>    It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,<br/>canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,<br/>Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY&gt; demanded cash for crude, and<br/>Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC&gt; asked for special safeguards.<br/>    The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP&gt; last<br/>week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today<br/>said, &quot;a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on<br/>supplying. They had cancelled last week.&quot;<br/>    He declined to identify the company.<br/>    &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.&gt;, the Venezuelan state oil<br/>company that supplies a large portion of Texaco&apos;s oil, also<br/>halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.<br/>    But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the<br/>Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key<br/>supply line.

Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn.,<br/>would require quotas on the import of any merchandise<br/>containing over 25 pct sugar or other farm products which are<br/>now subject to U.S. quotas.<br/>    Supporters of the amendment said it is aimed at curbing<br/>shipments of food products containing sugar from Canada.<br/>However, the Ways and Means committee, which has overall<br/>jurisdiction on trade legislation, will try to kill the<br/>amendment as protectionist, a committee aide said.<br/>    An Agriculture committee aide acknowledged the proposal<br/>probably will not survive scrutiny by other House committees.<br/>But he said the amendment was introduced in part to send a<br/>warning to U.S. companies considering moving food processing<br/>plants to Canada to avoid the restrictive U.S. sugar quota.<br/>    In debate on the amendment yesterday, Rep.

At the<br/>same time, however, the official expressed reservations that<br/>such a scheme would ever get off the ground.<br/>    The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine<br/>suggestions that &quot;exit bonds&quot; be issued to end the troublesome<br/>role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to<br/>underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan,<br/>the official said in an interview with Reuters.<br/>    &quot;All of these things would fit within the definition of our<br/>initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and<br/>unique approach such as those should be considered,&quot; said the<br/>official, who asked not to be named.<br/>    In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy<br/>under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such<br/>as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)<br/>were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.<br/>    In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact<br/>economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth.<br/>    &quot;The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors<br/>have been performing well,&quot; said the official. But he admitted<br/>that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an<br/>exception.<br/>    The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S.<br/>Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker,<br/>also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve<br/>their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis.<br/>    &quot;We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications<br/>to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more<br/>effectively,&quot; the official said.<br/>    Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that<br/>commercial banks create a &quot;megabank&quot; which could swap Third World<br/>debt paper for so-called &quot;exit bonds&quot; for banks like regional<br/>American or European institutions.<br/>    Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to<br/>lend money to their former debtors every time a new money<br/>package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in<br/>its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs.<br/>    He emphasised that the &quot;megabank&quot; was not an administration<br/>plan but &quot;something some people have suggested.&quot;<br/>    Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are<br/>examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third<br/>World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would<br/>differ slightly from the one the official described.<br/>    But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan<br/>would work in the United States.<br/>    &quot;If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go,<br/>fine. I don&apos;t think they ever will.&quot;<br/>    He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World<br/>loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant<br/>to provide new money to debtors through the new institution.<br/>    Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under<br/>which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no<br/>more than 5/8 pct above Libor.<br/>    &quot;The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it&apos;s quite<br/>unique and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s something that should be<br/>categorically rejected out of hand,&quot; the official said.<br/>    Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be<br/>offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin<br/>above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment<br/>Notes.<br/>    These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a<br/>six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before<br/>maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point<br/>over Libor.<br/>    Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too<br/>low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at<br/>stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and<br/>granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled<br/>debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support<br/>in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last<br/>year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt.<br/>    But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate<br/>capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the<br/>banks. &quot;It&apos;s no more interest rate capitalisation than if you<br/>have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed<br/>before,&quot; the official said in comments suggesting some ought to<br/>be granted the rate concessions they seek. &quot;Some people argue<br/>that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really<br/>is is narrowing the spread on new money,&quot; he added.<br/>    He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an<br/>initiative to include plans like the Philippines&apos;.<br/> Reuter<br/>","Ec","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ec","European sovereign debt crisis","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_sovereign_debt_crisis","","2"

At the<br/>same time, however, the official expressed reservations that<br/>such a scheme would ever get off the ground.<br/>    The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine<br/>suggestions that &quot;exit bonds&quot; be issued to end the troublesome<br/>role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to<br/>underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan,<br/>the official said in an interview with Reuters.<br/>    &quot;All of these things would fit within the definition of our<br/>initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and<br/>unique approach such as those should be considered,&quot; said the<br/>official, who asked not to be named.<br/>    In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy<br/>under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such<br/>as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)<br/>were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.<br/>    In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact<br/>economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth.<br/>    &quot;The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors<br/>have been performing well,&quot; said the official.

The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.<br/>    The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that<br/>said the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be<br/>consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate<br/>banking outside of New England come down. &quot;If we can consummate<br/>the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,&quot;<br/>Lougee said.

Today&apos;s relatively stable oil<br/>prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a<br/>return to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig<br/>count soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield<br/>roustabouts commanded premium wages.<br/>    The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT&gt; rig count, a<br/>barometer of the oil industry&apos;s health, showed 761 U.S. rigs<br/>active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.<br/>    In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but<br/>dived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil<br/>prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.<br/>    Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said &quot;In 1986, the United<br/>States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that<br/>replacement rate won&apos;t be any better this year.&quot;<br/>    He added, &quot;We don&apos;t have the options we do with oil.<br/>Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and<br/>importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible<br/>in the next 10 years because of the cost.&quot;<br/>    Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves<br/>were discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16<br/>trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.<br/>    George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co<br/>agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a<br/>new cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.<br/>    &quot;We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to<br/>dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990<br/>supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later<br/>than mid-1988,&quot; Gaspar said.<br/>    Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that<br/>could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count<br/>to peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.<br/>    Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be<br/>conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where<br/>federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the<br/>government unless drilling begins in the next two or three<br/>years. Some of the industry&apos;s biggest companies, such as Exxon<br/>Corp &lt;XON&gt;, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have<br/>already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later<br/>this year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.<br/>    For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont &lt;DD&gt; subsidiary, will<br/>spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico&apos;s deepest<br/>production platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of<br/>gas per day.<br/>    But T.

This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents<br/>a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in<br/>February last year following a sharp rise in international<br/>prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.<br/>    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,<br/>President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said<br/>they need to make hard commercial decisions. &quot;If we have failed<br/>at the ICO, at least we have tried,&quot; Dauster said, adding &quot;now it<br/>is time to go and sell coffee.&quot;<br/>    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans<br/>to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next<br/>month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade<br/>sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a<br/>previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public<br/>selling tenders for coffee bought on London&apos;s futures market<br/>last year.<br/>    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the<br/>market &quot;in one go&quot; but is sold over a minimum of six months.<br/>    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split<br/>between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for<br/>future quotas. Consumers said &quot;objective criteria&quot; like average<br/>exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,<br/>Dauster said.<br/>    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but<br/>consumers insisted they did not want a return to the &quot;ad hoc&quot; way<br/>of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst<br/>producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.<br/>    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and<br/>non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and<br/>that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set<br/>ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.<br/>    It is a &quot;simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate&quot;<br/>policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome<br/>to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very<br/>difficult to allocate as different &quot;objective criteria&quot; achieve<br/>different share-outs of quota, Dauster said.<br/>    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO<br/>and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.<br/>    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to<br/>accept the producers&apos; offer to abandon quotas if it proves<br/>impossible to find an acceptable basis for them.<br/>    &quot;We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to<br/>encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if<br/>supplies are needed at a later stage,&quot; one delegate said.<br/>    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer<br/>argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO<br/>session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse<br/>and how much producers will sink their differences should<br/>prices fall further and remain depressed.<br/>    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but<br/>both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real<br/>negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in<br/>Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.<br/>    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and<br/>politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could<br/>bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than<br/>many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during<br/>the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before<br/>October are unlikely, while Brazil&apos;s Dauster noted the ICO has<br/>continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.<br/>    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt<br/>by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been<br/>happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could<br/>not be imposed now.

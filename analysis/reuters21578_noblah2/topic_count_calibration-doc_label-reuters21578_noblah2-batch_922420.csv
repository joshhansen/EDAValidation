The spokesman noted the<br/>final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.<br/>    The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared<br/>with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and<br/>shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in<br/>the group's other divisions.<br/>    The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic<br/>group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend<br/>partly on the level of provisions.<br/>    Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine<br/>marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped<br/>to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.<br/>    The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks<br/>in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.<br/>Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.<br/>    The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by<br/>unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by<br/>poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.<br/>    The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter<br/>of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an<br/>additional factor behind the drop in results.<br/>    Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced<br/>would not begin to take full effect until this year.<br/>    Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion<br/>marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first<br/>time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its<br/>majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.<br/>    Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone<br/>was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison<br/>figures.<br/>    Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0<br/>pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose<br/>to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.<br/>    Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC)<br/>subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group<br/>accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of<br/>last year.<br/>    AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by the<br/>international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world<br/>group losses that year.<br/> REUTER<br/>","20","3","50","3","Fortis (finance)","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortis_(finance)","Tesco","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesco","","2"

The market also faces the regular weekly three- and<br/>six-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs.<br/>    The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly<br/>auspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting<br/>sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy<br/>U.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in<br/>Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar.<br/>    Moreover, the bond market's inertia has compared<br/>unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in<br/>high-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S.<br/>Equities.<br/>    But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are<br/>signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a<br/>bit.<br/>    'Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side,<br/>and there is a marked absence of selling,' they said in a weekly<br/>report.<br/>    Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes<br/>banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week's<br/>sales.<br/>    'The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings.<br/>Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these<br/>maturities has been wider, it is still positive,' he said in a<br/>weekly market review.<br/>    But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate<br/>enough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the<br/>overseas markets have had their run.<br/>    'Based on last week's events, there is little to indicate<br/>that the appetite for yield has begun to wane,' said economists<br/>at Salomon Brothers Inc.<br/>    Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors<br/>are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the<br/>higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal year<br/>on April 1.<br/>    And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big<br/>buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S.<br/>Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence.<br/>    Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian<br/>monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies<br/>should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond<br/>markets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said.<br/>    Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the<br/>U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations,<br/>economists said.<br/>    This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with<br/>February durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from<br/>January's depressed levels.<br/>    Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said<br/>several areas, including transport equipment, should have<br/>bounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap<br/>total new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after<br/>January's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain<br/>as large as five pct.<br/>    Friday's consumer price report for February is expected to<br/>show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain.<br/>Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the<br/>January rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food<br/>prices declined.<br/>    Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate<br/>will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the<br/>approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date.<br/>    Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this<br/>week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the<br/>new statement period beginning on Thursday.<br/>    Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected<br/>to open near that level.<br/> REUTER<br/>","100","3","10","1","Interbank lending market","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interbank_lending_market","Renminbi","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi","","1"

This week, many<br/>of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to<br/>agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work.<br/>    The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the<br/>International Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses<br/>running into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting<br/>a shadow over commodity negotiations.<br/>    The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to<br/>compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts<br/>with built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear<br/>lines drawn between aid and trade.<br/>    A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic<br/>elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in<br/>Geneva at the weekend.<br/>    Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa<br/>Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with<br/>quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to<br/>be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would<br/>'distort, not support' the market.<br/>    Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO<br/>for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee<br/>prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can<br/>founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa<br/>futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has<br/>also contributed to the recent slip in prices.<br/>    The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the<br/>'must buy' level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,<br/>which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but<br/>without rules for the operation of the buffer stock.<br/>    Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should<br/>operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement<br/>limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it<br/>cannot operate on futures markets.<br/>    A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost<br/>100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or<br/>selling operations, were carried forward from the previous<br/>agreement.<br/>    Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on<br/>all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.<br/>    The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on<br/>buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be<br/>over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should<br/>pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working<br/>group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative<br/>matters, and the full council meets on Thursday.<br/>    Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds<br/>should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member<br/>countries such as Malaysia.<br/>    Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer<br/>stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate<br/>manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.<br/>    The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked<br/>to the one over differentials for different qualities.<br/>    European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a<br/>compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can<br/>represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures<br/>market's existing differentials for different qualities.<br/>    Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto<br/>the London market.<br/>    Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50<br/>stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa.<br/>    Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would<br/>operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the<br/>highest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.<br/>    The January talks were slowed by a split inside the<br/>European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France<br/>siding with producers.

But there is no<br/>way they can trade their way out of this situation,' Aldo<br/>Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase<br/>Econometrics, said.<br/>    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the<br/>problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted<br/>world markets, but also had to work to make its position on<br/>foreign exchange markets more profitable.<br/>    'Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and<br/>exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange<br/>rates,' Roldan said.<br/>    The Chase economist also said commodities markets were<br/>depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a<br/>country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50<br/>pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23<br/>billion dlrs.<br/>    But he added: 'They are always pretty aggressive and they<br/>have good foreign marketing channels.'<br/>    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be<br/>coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign<br/>creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the<br/>market this year with a vengeance.<br/>    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization<br/>(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up<br/>earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing<br/>each other of intransigence.<br/>    'Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,<br/>which others wanted changed,' one senior coffee dealer said.<br/>    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to<br/>preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said<br/>Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others<br/>would suffer.<br/>    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but<br/>as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the<br/>dealer said.<br/>    'If they do come into the market at this level it will go<br/>lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,'<br/>he said.<br/>    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents<br/>lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant<br/>deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.<br/>    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster<br/>told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has<br/>no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of<br/>the ICO talks on export quotas.<br/>    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the<br/>focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. 'They<br/>will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,'<br/>according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache<br/>Securities Inc.<br/>    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus<br/>difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the<br/>Brazil soybean crop. 'Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and<br/>they can't afford to store the crops,' he said.<br/>    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time<br/>about large South American crops developing under near ideal<br/>conditions towards record yields.<br/>    'We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than<br/>usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,' Loewy said.<br/>    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean<br/>Association (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest<br/>could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.<br/>    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices<br/>are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the<br/>vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.<br/>    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a<br/>reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to<br/>farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.<br/>    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the<br/>soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices<br/>by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can<br/>forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the<br/>loan.<br/>    'We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are<br/>starting to harvest and starting to export,' Eshleman said.

An aide to Glickman<br/>said that it will probably be introduced next week.<br/>    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to<br/>forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency<br/>payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --<br/>only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under<br/>the current bill.<br/>    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,<br/>he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet<br/>budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than<br/>sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.<br/>    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a<br/>different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.<br/>    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government<br/>payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this<br/>point, he said.<br/>    'I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a<br/>decoupling bill this year.

His<br/>plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to<br/>participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to<br/>conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra<br/>idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres<br/>in a county and provide tenant protection provisions.<br/>    'I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but<br/>we can at least move in that direction,' Boschwitz said.<br/>    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified<br/>in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias<br/>in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'<br/>dependency on the government, he said.<br/>    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson<br/>said, and would still encourage farmers to plant.<br/>    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and<br/>the National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose<br/>any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the<br/>farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.<br/>    But when asked if his association were forced to choose<br/>between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry<br/>Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92<br/>rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.<br/> Reuter<br/>","50","4","100","0","Glass–Steagall Act","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass–Steagall_Act","Michele Bachmann","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Bachmann","","2"

The budget was<br/>unveiled on March 17.<br/>    'The PSBR (Public Sector Borrowing Requirement) has come out<br/>lower than I forecast in the Budget. Inflation, too, is lower<br/>than I suggested ... (and) the current account of the balance<br/>of payments is also performing better, so far, than I<br/>predicted.'<br/>    The budget foresaw inflation easing to 4.0 pct at the end<br/>of this year after peaking at around 4.5 pct. Lawson said at<br/>the time that the overall 1986/87 PSBR would be around 4.0<br/>billion stg. It was in fact lower, at 3.3 billion stg.<br/>    He had also projected average GDP growth in calendar 1987<br/>of 3.0 pct after 2.5 pct in 1986. Lawson today said 'output<br/>appears to be rising, if anything, rather faster.'<br/>    Speaking during a House of Commons debate, he said, 'by the<br/>end of this year we will have registered the longest period of<br/>steady growth, at close to 3.0 pct a year, that the British<br/>economy has known since the (Second World) War.'<br/>    The 1987/88 budget contained a proposal to cut the basic<br/>rate of taxation by two pence, to 27 pence in the pound.<br/>    Lawson today reaffirmed that the government aimed to<br/>further cut the standard rate to 'no more than 25p.' He said that<br/>that objective 'should not take too long to achieve.'<br/>    Turning to policies proposed by political opposition<br/>parties, Lawson said those advocated by the Labour Party would<br/>entail extra public expenditure of some 34 billion stg.<br/>    That, he said, 'would require either a doubling of the basic<br/>rates of income tax or more than trebling the standard rate of<br/>(valued added tax) VAT,' which is currently 15 pct.<br/>    On value added tax, Lawson noted that the Conservative<br/>government promised back in 1984 not to extend VAT to food.<br/>    'Beyond that, the incidence of taxation has to be determined<br/>in the light of the budgetary needs at the time, and no<br/>responsible government could conceivably take any other<br/>position,' he said.

They pointed to two factors that may have<br/>forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.<br/>    First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week<br/>ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,<br/>partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the<br/>proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to<br/>pay annual income taxes.<br/>    As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the<br/>reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.<br/>    Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion<br/>dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists<br/>said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the<br/>projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to<br/>add reserves too late.<br/>    Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently<br/>left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which<br/>to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists<br/>said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos<br/>outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add<br/>even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.<br/>    'It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as<br/>much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,'<br/>said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.<br/>    McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting<br/>discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,<br/>equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.<br/>    After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not<br/>tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,<br/>economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging <br/>overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the<br/>statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.<br/>    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that<br/>the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's<br/>figures, he said, 'It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving<br/>toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.'<br/>    Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8<br/>pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate<br/>unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.<br/>    Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political<br/>opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time<br/>when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to<br/>reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.<br/> Reuter<br/>","50","3","20","3","Subprime mortgage crisis","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis","Banks","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banks","","1"

'But<br/>the feeling is that many of those externals have been<br/>discounted in the price of the stocks.'<br/>    Adelman, who issued a positive recommendation on Philip<br/>Morris earlier this week, said there have been indications that<br/>the Reagan Administration's staunch opposition to tax hikes<br/>would short-circuit attempts to tax tobacco.<br/>    'The tobaccos do have more risks than regular consumer<br/>stocks because of these external factors,' Adelman said. 'They<br/>are not for the weak-hearted, but they offer a lot of value for<br/>the aggressive investor.'<br/>    In a market where everyone is looking for affordable<br/>stocks, trader Drew Schaefer of Kidder Peabody said, it is not<br/>hard to understand why the tobaccos, which have been depressed<br/>for a while in a positive market, are attracting buyers.<br/>    Adelman believes one of the better buys is Philip Morris.<br/>'It is a powerhouse of potential growth in earnings, dividends<br/>and free cash flow.
